## Explainability (XAI): Lecture notes

1. [Introduction](https://lorentzenchr.github.io/responsible_ml_material/xai_1_introduction.html)
2. [Explaining Models](https://lorentzenchr.github.io/responsible_ml_material/xai_2_explaining_models.html)
3. [Improving Explainability](https://lorentzenchr.github.io/responsible_ml_material/xai_3_improving_explainability.html)

### Remarks

- The .rmd files in the main folder can produce the linked html output. 
- You can also use them to go through the code step by step. The first time you run each script, you need to set `refit = TRUE`. It will fit and save the models. After this, simply use `refit = FALSE` and the scripts will run much faster.
- The last chapter requires Keras. This means, you need a Python/TensorFlow installation. Follow [these instructions](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/reference/keras/install_keras).
